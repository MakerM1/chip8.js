# CHIP-8 Emulator

This is a CHIP-8 emulator written in JavaScript as a fun side project to learn about emulation. CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language used on early microcomputers, and building an emulator for it is a great way to understand low-level computing.

## Features

* Emulates the CHIP-8 CPU and instruction set
* Renders 64x32 pixel graphics using HTML5 <canvas>
* Handles input from a 16-key hexadecimal keypad
* Supports timers for delay and sound

## Controls

The CHIP-8's 16-key input is mapped to your keyboard:
CHIP-8 Key	Keyboard

| CHIP-8 Key | Keyboard |
| ---------- | --------:|
| 1 (0x1)    | 1        |
| 2 (0x2)    | 2        |
| 3 (0x3)    | 3        |
| C (0xc)    | 4        |
| 4 (0x4)    | Q        |
| 5 (0x5)    | W        |
| 6 (0x6)    | E        |
| D (0xd)    | R        |
| 7 (0x7)    | A        |
| 8 (0x8)    | S        |
| 9 (0x9)    | D        |
| E (0xe)    | F        |
| A (0xa)    | Z        |
| 0 (0x0)    | X        |
| B (0xb)    | C        |
| F (0xf)    | V        |

## Why I Built This

I created this project to learn more about emulators and low-level computing. Itâ€™s a great way to start building more complex emulators like the NES.
